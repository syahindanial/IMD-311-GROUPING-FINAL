            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>"The Hijab Closet" is the name of our company. It was founded in 2020 after being inspired 
                by a Korean skin care store called "fabs" in Mitsui Sepang. The idea behind this business is to 
                sell Tudung gathered from various local brands from all over Malaysia. The primary goal of this 
                company is to promote all local products more broadly. Furthermore, it strives to create a 
                welcoming and supportive customer community. Additionally, by diversifying the types of hijabs in 
                different styles, colours, and materials, we are meeting the needs of women who want to express 
                their beliefs and cultural identity through their choice of wear. Overall, The Hijab Closet Boutique 
                is a company that is dedicated to providing high-quality, fashionable hijabs while also promoting 
                cultural awareness and diversity in the fashion industry</p>
